# Current Development Plan

Persistent planning across context resets.

## Active Initiative

**Initiative**: OCI AI Architect Best Practices
**Started**: 2026-01-05
**Target**: Production-ready OCI AI toolkit

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
- [x] CLAUDE.md with OCI focus
- [x] 6 core skills
- [x] Knowledge base documentation
- [x] Terraform templates

### Phase 2: Best Practices (Complete)
- [x] .claude/ infrastructure
- [x] skill-rules.json for auto-activation
- [x] Slash commands (deploy-dac, build-rag)
- [x] dev-docs/ persistence

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Backlog)
- [ ] Split oversized skills
- [ ] More Terraform modules
- [ ] OCI AI Services examples
- [ ] Testing framework

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| OCI-only focus | Dedicated deep expertise vs. multi-cloud breadth | 2026-01-05 |
| Separate from ai-architect | Different use cases, focused documentation | 2026-01-05 |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we add OCI Functions for serverless AI?
- [ ] Integration with OCI Data Science platform?
